#+title: websocket-bridge

* Background

This project is inspired by deno-bridge. Deno-bridge provides a great idea to create a WebSocket connection between emacs and deno, making emacs communicate with deno.

But when I write emacs plugins, I need a python package to provide some ability. So I try to transplant deno-bridge to python.

When I try to implement /python-bridge/, I think I could make it more general as /websocket-bridge/.

* Theory

Emacs uses emacs-websocket to create a WebSocket server; other language extensions make WebSocket clients connect to the emacs server. So emacs can communicate with other languages' programs.
