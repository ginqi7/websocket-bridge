#+title: websocket-bridge

* Background

This project is inspired by deno-bridge. deno-bridge provides a great idea to create websocket connection between emacs and deno, making emacs communicate with deno.

But when I write emacs plugins, I need python package to provide some ability. So I try to transplant deno-bridge to python.

When I try to implement 'python-bridge', I think I could make it more general as 'websocket-bridge'.

* Theory

Emacs uses emacs-websocket to create a websocket server; other language extensions make websocket clients connect the emacs server. So emacs can communicate with other languages' programs.
